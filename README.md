# Program_Note_Engilsh

I used the toolkit Boostrap in my code to create the program of the random draw student.

This feature allows me to do the web site thanks to the documentation of Bootstrap to make the CSS and the JavaScript with an existing model. Bootstrap saves me time to create my page HTML with the speed of the edition compared with one file CSS, another file JavaScript where we need to edit all the time. Moreover, utilization of Bootstrap presents a web site responsive without bugs.

Thereafter I make a button ‘Choose file’ to upload a list in CSV format, next door you can read the name of your file after having uploaded it. On the right of the upload button and the name of your file, you can see the button to ‘Select random student’ in the list of your file, the random selection is based on the number 0 corresponding with the first column where there is the name and first name of the class. 

Lower, you have the functionalities to note the student, you can write with your keyboard or press an arrow to choose numbers between 0 and the maximum number of scales. The score is calculated constantly in front of you. Then you can write a comment on the performance of the student if you need. 

Finally, you have three buttons, on the left the button ‘Save’ allows you to save notes and comments of the student evaluated in a copy of your file with news columns. Then if you need your evaluation file, you press the button ‘Download All Results’ to download the new CSV based on your file. 

If you read this with my red button “ReadMe”, you are on a google docs shared from Google Drive. Else the functionality is available.
